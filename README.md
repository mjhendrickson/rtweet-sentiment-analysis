Sentiment Analysis of Tweets via rtweet

## A Learn Out Loud Project
This project is a "learning out loud" project. I will Tweet about this project as it evolves and progresses. You can find me on Twitter here [@mjhendrickson](https://twitter.com/mjhendrickson).

## Project Details
Additional detail about the project and plan can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/mjhendrickson/rtweet-sentiment-analysis/wiki).

## A Note on Rendering the .html File
Note: The .html files do not render directly as a true .html file in GitHub. GitHub & BitBucket HTML Preview works well to convert these .html files into viewable webpages. Try it here https://htmlpreview.github.io/.
